# EasyBuild
<h2>Easier way to build executables via PyInstaller!</h2>

<h3>Usage:</h3>

Make sure you have PyInstaller installed:
```
pip3 install pyinstaller
```
<p>Download the "build.bat" file.</p>
<p>Create a new directory/folder.</p>
<p>Move the "build.bat" file into that folder, along with your python script.</p>
<p>"build.bat" will automatically recognize the .py file.</p>
<p></p>Make sure to ONLY include ONE .py file in the root project directory!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Run the "build.bat" file from the file manager, or the terminal.</p>
<p>The executable will be located in the directory "Built_EXE"</p>
